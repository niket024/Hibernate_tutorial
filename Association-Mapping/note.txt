Using hibernate we can put the following 4 types of relationships

One-To-One
Many-To-One
One-To-Many
Many-To-Many


One to One Mapping
---------------------
1. One object is associated with one object only

2. In this relationship, one object of the one pojo class contains association 
with one object of the another pojo class

3. To apply one to one relationship between two pojo class objects it is possible by without taking
a separate foreign key column in the child table of the database

4. To apply one to one relationship, we copy the primary key value of parent object 
into primary key value of the child object.
So that the relationship between two objects is one to one

5. If we want to copy parent object primary key value into child object primary key, 
we need to use a special generator class given by hibernate called foreign

6. Actually this foreign generator is only used in one to one relationship only

7. We are going to apply one to one between student and address pojo classes, 
here the relation is one address is assigned for one student only

8. In order to get one to one relationship between student and address, 
we are copying primary key value of student into primary key value of address

One to Many Mapping
---------------------
One-to-Many:  according to database terminology, 
one row of table related with multiple rows of other table

According to hibernate, one object of one pojo class related to multiple objects of other pojo
I mean, one [parent] to many [Children], 
example of one-to-many is some thing category books contains different type of books,
one vendor contains lot of customers bla bla.

To achieve one-to-many between two pojo classes in the hibernate, 
then the following two changes are required

In the parent pojo class, we need to take a collection property, 
the collection can be either Set,List,Map

In the POJO class of that parent, we need to add the collection
